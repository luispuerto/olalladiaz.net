## What is this about

This a collection of posts (a blog?) without pretension, I am mainly writing for myself things that I think will be useful for me or others. Things are mainly selected because  I forget things that I did, or that same questions are repetatedly coming to me: How did you do this and that? Where did you find that hing?.; my idea is to answer those question here.
