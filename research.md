# Research

In my research, I focus on forest change and stand dynamics, I am particularly interested in how natural disturbances and management change forest and the consequences that they have on ecosystem services. I also found very exciting to do research on the uncertain future of forests; what forest management actions are going to provide the products and services that society demands now and in the future; what if future variations in clima change the forest as we know it;  can we manage forests to make them more resilient to changes from climate; what actions we have to take in the future if the main role of a forest is to be the habitat of certain wildlife specie, or to produce timber, or to capture carbon,  can we reduce the risk of damage from disturbances, how much, where; how we consider all these aspects in time and space,... I know it sounds complex, it is complex! thats why is so interesting and exciting. In general, I find fun in data, I like to immerse myself in numbers looking for answers, create models that help to understand things and use them to predict how the future might look like.
