Science Communication generally refers to public communication of scientific-related topics not only targeting the scientific community. Or in other words how scientist should communicate their work if they want to be understood by someone else than their peers.

This section of my personal web is an attempt to become a better communicator of science. Here I will collect my work and others people work that I find useful and inspirational. More coming soon!
