# Forest Risk

##  **WHAT HAVE WE FIGURED OUT ABOUT FOREST DAMAGES IN NORWAY?**

We wanted to understand what disturbances are affecting the Norwegian forests and how often are they occurring. We analysed the Norwegian National Forest Inventory that collects re-measurements of permanent plots during 20 years. We found that the main forest damages in Norway are wind, snow, browsing, fungus and insects. The highest damage occurrence in Norwegian forests are due to ungulate browsing, followed by snow and wind. In general, browsing damage causes the most severe losses and snow presents a decreasing temporally trend in damage frequency.

### HOW DOES FOREST COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE AFFECT THE STABILITY AGAINST WIND AND SNOW?

Certain stand characteristics make some stands more vulnerable than others to wind and snow damaged. Typical forest damages from snow and wind are uprooted and broken trees.  In this study we were trying to identify which stand variables make a certain stand more vulnerable to suffer snow and wind damage and the effect this variables had. We found that  in Norway, after the impact of snow or wind, trees are more commonly uprooted than broken. Tree mean diameter, mean height and slenderness are important variables that change the probability of a tree to be uprooted or broken. But other aspects like the stand structure are also relevant, for example Spruce trees in stands with more heterogeneous structures are less prone to suffer breakage.

### **WHAT VARIABLES MAKE A FOREST STAND VULNERABLE TO BROWSING DAMAGE?**

Browsing damage is an important issue for forest managers but challenging to consider because it is very difficult to predict the ungulates behaviour.  Another option is to identify which forest variables make the forest more attractive to  ungulates. We used the forest stand variables from browsing damaged and undamaged plots to determine what of those variables made the stand more vulnerable to suffer the damage.

We found out that young stands of birch, pine and mixed species were the most vulnerable. We also noticed that the stand size plays an important role on forest susceptibility and should be taken into consideration when making management decisions that want to consider the risk of browsing damage.

### **CURRENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**

We are now looking at how we can predict the probability of a stand to be damaged and how we can identify the specific probability of one tree to be uprooted or broken considering the stand damage occurrence probability and damage impact.
